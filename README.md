Information about OpenWindows license compatibility. The OWL (OpenWindows License) is supposed to only
be compatible with free open-source licenses.

This repository contains a file called `compat-howto.md` which contains a Mermaid graph showing how
choosing OWL compatibility works.

This compatibility is layed out for OWL 2.0, which should be released to the general public in around 2027.
